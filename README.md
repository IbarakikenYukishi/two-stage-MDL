# Change and Change Sign Detection

## 1. About
This repository contains the following implementation code of change and change sign detection algorithms.
- Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) [1]
- ChangeFinder (CF) [2]
- Differential MDL change statistics (D-MDL) [3]
	- Sequential differential MDL (SDMDL)
	- Hierarchical sequential differential MDL (HSDMDL)
- Two-stage MDL change statistics
	- Fixed-windowing two-stage MDL (FW2S-MDL)
	- Adaptive-windowing two-stage MDL (AW2S-MDL)

## 2. Environment
- CPU: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
- OS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6
- Memory: 8GB 1867 MHz DDR3
- python: 3.6.4. with Anaconda.

## 3. How to Run
- Run the script at `./experiment/parameter_AUC.py` for the AUC evaluation of each method.
- Run the script at `./experiemnt/parameter_F1_score.py` for the F1-score evaluation of each method.
